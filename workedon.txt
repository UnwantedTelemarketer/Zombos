added saving entities when leaving chunks 

just the special ones now, took too long

chat gave us a name generator (kinda like one i wrote a while ago)

we use this to generate names for npcs, but only when we talk to them
to keep anonymity before we meet them

moved human spawn into its own function

made campfires and roads spawn these special humans too

ran into a bug where chunks werent unloading (multithreading issue)

FINALLY got an npc to respawn with their data

made hitting an npc lower reputation
